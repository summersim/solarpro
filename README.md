# SolarPro

## Getting Started

Create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

In `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find the `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app. This is necessary for using [Thirdweb hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and [UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components).

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you need to set up environment variables. Check the `.env.example` file for required variables and add them to `.env.local` or configure them in your hosting provider.

## Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
